# Project Description

This project is a chess application that uses a chess engine to facilitate gameplay. The project requires two terminal windows to run simultaneously, and currently, the engine-related functions are only supported on Windows systems.

## Running Instructions

Since the project is not packaged as an executable file, you need to open two terminal windows in the root directory of the application. Follow these steps:

1. In the first terminal, run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In the second terminal, run the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

**Note:** Some of the functions related to the chess engine are currently implemented only for Windows systems, so the application may not work properly on other operating systems.

## Chess Engine

You may use Stockfish as the chess engine. Make sure to run the engine on a Windows system for full compatibility.
